\section Overview

alSurface is a physically plausible, catch-all surface shader designed to represent all common surface types, with the exception of hair.

\section Parameters

- Diffuse:
	- Scale: An overall multiplier on the strength of the diffuse-reflected light
	- Color: Color of the diffuse-reflected light
	- Roughness: Oren-Nayar roughness parameter. Higher values flatten the shading and make the surface appear flatter
